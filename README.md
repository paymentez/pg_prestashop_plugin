## 4.- Considerations and Comments
### 4.1.- Refunds
- The **1.0.0** plugin version does not support the **Partial Refunds** by Prestashop. However the plugin supports **Standard Refunds** by Prestashop. 
- The **Standard Refund** can be interpreted as a partial refund on Paymentez side, the success of the operation depends on the configured payment network accepting partial refunds.
### 4.2.- Webhook
- The Paymentez Prestashop plugin has an internal webhook in order to keep updated the transactions statuses between Prestashop and Paymentez.
- The webhook its located on **http://{my_store}/prestashop/es/module/pg_prestashop_plugin/webhook**, this url will be configured on the CLIENT/SERVER credentials.
